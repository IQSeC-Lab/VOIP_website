        Machine Learning-Driven Fingerprintability of Encrypted VoIP Traffic
      </h1>
    </div>
    <div id="abstract">
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Voice-over-IP (VoIP) systems like Telegram, WhatsApp, Viber, and
        Facebook Messenger are widely used for secure communication, relying on
        end-to-end (E2E) encryption to protect users from unauthorized access
        and surveillance. However, this study explores the potential for
        fingerprinting VoIP network traffic, challenging the assumption that E2E
        encryption fully secures user privacy.<br /><br />
        This research aims to investigate whether side-channel information—such
        as packet timestamps, direction, statistics, and sizes—can be exploited
        to infer sensitive details from encrypted VoIP traffic. The study will
        employ advanced machine learning (ML) techniques, including 1-D
        convolutional neural networks and large language models (LLMs), to
        analyze this information and assess its effectiveness in revealing
        communication characteristics, such as the language used, types of
        content shared, and conversation topics. <br /><br />
        Given the limited research in this area, particularly concerning the
        fingerprintability of VoIP traffic, this study seeks to fill a critical
        gap. By uncovering potential vulnerabilities, the findings will
        contribute to a deeper understanding of privacy risks in VoIP
        communications. The outcomes are expected to inform the development of
        enhanced security measures, ensuring that VoIP systems remain resilient
        against emerging threats and continue to protect user privacy.

      <h2>Work Done So Far</h2>
      <p>Our research focuses on capturing and analyzing network packets generated by the Telegram application. To achieve this, we utilize the Telegram API to send and receive messages, combined with TCPDump for capturing the associated packets. By identifying and targeting specific IP address ranges used by Telegram, we ensure that our data collection is accurate and relevant. The identified IP families include:</p>
      <ul>
        <div>
        <h3>IPv4 Ranges:</h3>
        <li>149.154.164.0/22</li>
        <li>149.154.172.0/22</li>
        <li>91.108.4.0/22</li>
        <li>91.108.56.0/24</li>
    </div>
        <div>
        <h3>IPv6 Ranges:</h3>
        <li>2001:67c:4e8::/48</li>
        <li>2001:b28:f23d::/48</li>
        </div>
      </ul>
      <p>Once we successfully isolated the packets associated with the Telegram API, we enhanced the data generation process by developing Python scripts integrated with artificial intelligence. These scripts leverage the Groq AI API to simulate realistic conversations between two users. The conversation simulation scripts are combined into a single executable program that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Runs both chatbot instances.</li>
        <li>Initiates TCPDump to capture network packets during their interaction.</li>
        <li>Exports the captured packets into a PCAP file for analysis upon program termination.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Data Collection Approaches</h3>
      <div id="diagram">
        <div>
          <h3 style="margin-block: 20px;">Controlled Version</h3>  
          <p>In the controlled approach, we automate packet capture using the Python scripts described earlier. This allows us to simulate extensive, topic-specific conversations between two users. Since the topics are predefined, this method enables simultaneous data capture and labeling, providing a structured dataset ideal for training and testing network analysis algorithms.</p>

        <div>
          <h3 style="margin-block: 20px;">Real-World Version</h3>  
          <p>The real-world approach involves passively monitoring network traffic in a live environment. Here, packets are filtered to isolate those of interest (e.g., Telegram-related traffic). However, unlike the controlled approach, this method does not provide information about the content or context of the conversation. It captures raw packets without labeling, making it less structured but potentially more reflective of actual network conditions.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Building on our ability to capture packets from chat conversations between two clients, we aim to extend this methodology to Voice over IP (VOIP) calls. Once successful, we will collect and analyze the packet exchanges associated with these calls. This extension will allow us to explore the patterns and characteristics of VOIP traffic within the Telegram ecosystem, broadening the scope of our research and providing valuable insights into real-time communication data.</p>
